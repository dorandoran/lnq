## About

[LNQ](https://lnqapp.io/) is a blockchain-based event discovery platform that aims to empower users by providing a safe and transparent NFT ticketing marketplace, offering social features to inform and influence purchasing decisions, and rewarding user interaction with incentives facilitated by ecosystem involvement.

[LNQ](https://lnqapp.io/) users can create events, discover events, buy and sell NFT tickets, share their experiences, interact with friends, earn countless rewards for ecosystem participation, and influence in-app features and other concepts.

### NFT Marketplace and Ticketing

Organizers are able to sell tickets as NFTs on [LNQ](https://lnqapp.io/). Those who mint NFT tickets will be able to transfer or resell. Organizers can earn royalties from secondary sales.

Organizers will be able to set passthrough percentages for event contributors, determine resale specifications, and offer perks to ticket holders among other things. In addition, offering tickets as NFT collectibles poses a unique opportunity for event organizers to build a viable and interactive community.

Every NFT is unique and impossible to counterfeit. This eliminates the possibility of fraud, scalping, and automated bot activity.

Most importantly users are protected by fraud, scalping, and automated bot activity. In addition, ticket holders will gain access to unique digital and tangible assets and/or experiences provided by organizers.

Tickets are recorded from the original sale to any sale thereafter, allowing organizers to monitor ticket history and purchasers to verify the legitimacy of each ticket.

[LNQ](https://lnqapp.io/) aims to be a multi-chain marketplace; being compatible with blockchains that have minimum transaction fees that are a fraction of a cent, so costs to mint, buy, sell, and transfer NFTs are minimal.
